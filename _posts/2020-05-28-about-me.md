This is my first post. Here's a bit about who I am and why I started this blog :).

## Who am I?

![acadia-portrait](/assets/images/acadia.jpg)

My name is [Daniel Deychakiwsky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieldeychak/) 
(pronounced "day-check-eve-ski"). 
The long last name is Ukrainian. Hello! Привіт! 
Professionally by day, I'm a senior machine learning engineer.
I have about 10 years of software engineering experience,
two Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees, and a Master of Science (MS) degree.
I'm an engineer passionate for solving real world problems with 
applied artificial intelligence. I'm currently enjoying the 
intersection of deep generative learning, reinforcement learning, 
and digital signal processing.

## Why am I doing this?

As a proponent of continuous-learning,
online-education, and decentralization of knowledge,
the purpose of this blog is to share concepts that I've found to be interesting,
practical, and application-effective. Additionally, accurately reproducing
information aids in retention of that information; in other words, I'm learning too.

## What's a Deylemma?

I named this blog by concatenating the first three letters of my last name with
the first mathematical term that came to mind that together was easy to remember.

> In mathematics, informal logic and argument mapping,
>a lemma is a generally minor, proven proposition which is used as a
>stepping stone to a larger result.
