This is my first post. Here's a bit about who I am and why I started this blog :).

## Who am I?

![headshot](/assets/images/headshot.png)
 
Professionally by day, I'm a senior machine learning engineer.
I have about 10 years of software engineering experience,
two Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees, and a Master of Science (MS) degree.
I'm passionate for solving real world problems with 
applied artificial intelligence. I'm currently enjoying the 
intersection of deep generative learning, reinforcement learning, 
and digital signal processing. In my spare time, I make 
[music](https://soundcloud.com/daniel-deychakiwsky) 
(toured in a band for 2 years), play tennis (ex-soccer), and travel.

## Why am I doing this?

As a proponent of continuous-learning,
online-education, and decentralization of knowledge,
the purpose of this blog is to share concepts that I've found to be interesting,
practical, and application-effective. Additionally, accurately reproducing
information aids in retention of that information; in other words, I'm learning too.
