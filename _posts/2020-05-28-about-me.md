This is my first post. Here's a bit about who I am and why I started this blog :).

## Who am I?

![acadia-portrait](/assets/images/acadia.jpg)

Hello! Привіт!

My name is Daniel Deychakiwsky (pronounced "day-check-eve-ski"). The long last name is Ukrainian.
We like to shorten it to "Deychak" for obvious reasons :).

By day, I'm a senior machine learning / artificial intelligence engineer.
I have about 10 years of software engineering experience,
two bachelor degrees, and one masters degree. I live in Austin,
TX with my girlfriend and our dog Bondi (named after our favorite Australian beach).

## Why am I doing this?

As a proponent of continuous-learning,
online-education, and decentralization of knowledge,
the purpose of this blog is to share concepts that I've found to be interesting,
practical, and application-effective. Additionally, accurately reproducing
information aids in retention of that information; in other words, I'm learning too.

## What's a Deylemma?

I named this blog by concatenating the first three letters of my last name with
the first mathematical term that came to mind that together was easy to remember.

> In mathematics, informal logic and argument mapping,
>a lemma is a generally minor, proven proposition which is used as a
>stepping stone to a larger result.
