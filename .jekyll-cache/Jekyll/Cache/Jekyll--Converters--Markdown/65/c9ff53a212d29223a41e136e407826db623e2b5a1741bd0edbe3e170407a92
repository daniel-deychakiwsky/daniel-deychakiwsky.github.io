<p>Hello! –ü—Ä–∏–≤—ñ—Ç!</p>

<p>My name is Daniel Deychakiwsky (pronounced ‚Äúday-check-eve-ski‚Äù). The long last name is Ukrainian.
We like to shorten it to ‚ÄúDeychak‚Äù to save people from tumbling down
all <strong>12</strong> letters :).</p>

<p>By day, I‚Äôm a machine-learning / artificial-intelligence engineer.
I have about 10 years of software-engineering experience,
two bachelor degrees, and one masters degree. I live in Brooklyn,
NY with my girlfriend (who is an actor / comedian / model) and
our dog Bondi (named after our favorite Australian beach).</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-doing-this">Why am I doing this?</h2>

<p>As a proponent of continuous-learning,
online-education, and decentralization of knowledge,
the purpose of this blog is to share concepts that I‚Äôve found to be interesting,
practical, and application-effective. Additionally, accurately reproducing
information aids in retention of that information; in other words, I‚Äôm learning too.</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-deylemma">What‚Äôs a Deylemma?</h2>

<p>I named this blog by concatenating the first three letters of my last name with
the first mathematical term that came to mind that together was easy to remember.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In mathematics, informal logic and argument mapping,
a lemma is a generally minor, proven proposition which is used as a
stepping stone to a larger result.</p>
