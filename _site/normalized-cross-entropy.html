<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>Let’s assume we are machine-learning engineers at a technology company
that monetizes its flagship product with advertisements.</p>

<p>The business has invoked our expertise to model click conversions;
we need to provide a score for how likely a given user is to click on
a given ad. The business can then use the scores to optimize various objectives,
i.e., choose which ads to show. We collect data by logging user-ad interactions
to keep track of what users saw what ad and if those ad-impressions resulted in a click.
We can join the logs with preexisting user and ad-specific data. In the simplest case,
our task it to train a model to output the probability that a user will click based on the
data we’ve collected.</p>

\[P(click \space | \space user,ad)
\tag 1 \label 1\]

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam’s Razor</a> problem solving approach tells us that starting out with a simple model
is usually a good first start. We begin by applying a well-studied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model">generalized linear model</a> (GLM),
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a> (LR), which models a binary response random variable.
It outputs a probability, $\hat p$, for predicted membership to the positive class
as a deterministic function, $h$, of some feature embedding, $\textbf x$,
parameterized by, $\boldsymbol{\hat \theta}$, our current hypothesis.</p>

\[\hat p=\\
P(\hat y=1 \space | \space \textbf x;\boldsymbol{\hat \theta})=\\
h_\boldsymbol{\hat \theta}(\textbf{x})
\tag 2 \label 2\]

<p>The goal of learning is to approximate nature’s hypothetical target function which maps a
full-relationship for some inputs to a true target value. Whatever your view on reality or spin on
probability, lets assume a true probabilistic binary generative process so that we can draw an
analog to the LR model. We express nature by recycling notation from \ref{2}.</p>

\[p=\\
P(y=1 \space | \space \textbf x;\boldsymbol{\theta})=\\
h_\boldsymbol{\theta}(\textbf{x})
\tag 3 \label 3\]

<p>Fueled by data, LR learns by iteratively adjusting its model parameters, $\boldsymbol{\hat \theta}$,
so that its predictions are better aligned to nature (what’s been observed).
Specialized algorithms can be applied to guide an informative search through an
infinite-sized hypothesis (parameter) space to find a hypothesis (or the parameters) that best
reflects reality.</p>

<p>Challenges may arise from model complexity, measurement noise, and insufficient data.
If our model is unable to capture the complexity of the target function it will fail
to generalize. If our model is overly complex, it may mistakenly learn the noise in our training 
data and fail to generalize. Moreover, if the data is not predictive, of low-quality,
or is missing, there wouldn’t be much to learn; garbage in, garbage out.</p>

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p>We must carefully select an evaluation metric which enables us to measure
and compare model performance. We evaluate our model’s generalization capabilities on a
test or holdout-set of data for which the model has not been 
exposed to during training. Since we know if the user has clicked or not, we can
assess the model’s predictions against reality. A good model will be better aligned to reality.</p>

<p>After researching many metrics,
we consider Normalized Cross-Entropy (NCE).</p>

<h3 id="facebook-research">Facebook research</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Normalized Cross-Entropy is equivalent to the
  average log-loss per impression divided by what the
  average log-loss per impression would be if a model predicted the
  background click through rate
  (CTR) for every impression. [1]</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>

<ul>
  <li>$N$ is the size of the test-set (total number of ad-impressions).</li>
  <li>$CTR$ is the observed click-through rate (proportion of clicks to ad-impressions) in the test-set.</li>
  <li>$\hat p$, where $\{ \hat p \in \mathbb{R} \space | \space 0 \le \hat p \le 1\}$, is
our model’s predicted probability score (that the user will click).</li>
  <li>$p$, where $p \in \{0, 1\}$, is the observed probability score (often referred to as the label).
    <ul>
      <li>1 indicates that the user did click
  (the probability of click is 1 since we’re certain they clicked);
  $P(click \space | \space user,ad)=1$.</li>
      <li>0 indicates that the user didn’t click
  (the probability of click is 0 since we’re certain they didn’t click);
  $P(click \space | \space user,ad)=0$.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="equation">Equation</h3>

\[NCE=\\
\frac
{
-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (p_i ln(\hat p_i) + (1-p_i) ln(1-\hat p_i))
}
{
-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (p_i ln(CTR) + (1-p_i) ln(1-CTR))
}
\tag 4 \label 4\]

<h2 id="what-is-log-loss">What is log-Loss?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>In mathematical optimization and decision theory,
  a loss function or cost function is a function that
  maps an event or values of one or more variables onto
  a real number intuitively representing some “cost”
  associated with the event.
  An optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function. [7]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Log-loss can be derived from several schools of thought. In the case of binary classification,
derivations yield equivalence.</p>

<h3 id="probability-theory-derivation">Probability Theory derivation</h3>

<h4 id="bernoulli">Bernoulli</h4>

<p>A user’s true click propensity for a single ad-impression, $Y$, follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution">Bernoulli distribution</a>.
Since, the user will click with some probability, $p$, and 
not-click with the complement probability, $1-p$, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function">probability mass function</a> (PMF)
can be expressed in-line.</p>

\[Y \sim Bernoulli(p)=\\
p^k(1-p)^{1-k} \space\space\space for \space k \in \{0, 1\}
\tag 5 \label 5\]

<p>GLMs relate a linear predictor to the conditional expected value of the estimated response variable
by applying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model#Link_function">link function</a>. LR estimates the expected value of a Bernoulli-distributed response
variable by piping a linear predictor through an inverse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit">logit</a> link function.</p>

\[\mathbb{E}[\hat Y|X]=\\
\hat p=\\
g^{-1}(X \theta)=\\
h_{\theta}(X)
\tag 6 \label 6\]

<p>The linear predictor is a function of some feature embedding, $\textbf x$, parameterized by a
model hypothesis, $\boldsymbol{\hat \theta}$. Per equation \ref{2}, $h$ represents the final output,
that is, after the linear transform’s output passes through the link function.</p>

\[\hat Y \sim Bernoulli(\hat p)=\\
Bernoulli(h_\boldsymbol{\hat \theta}(\textbf x))
\tag 7 \label 7\]

<p>In order to estimate $p$ we invoke <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation">maximum likelihood estimation</a> over our training set.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating
  the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a likelihood function,
  so that under the assumed statistical model the observed data is most probable. [8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to find the maximum likelihood estimate, we must define the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function">likelihood function</a> 
for our data and then maximize it. The value $\hat p$ takes
at the maximum is our maximum likelihood estimate for the true parameter $p$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In statistics, the likelihood function (often simply called the likelihood)
  measures the goodness of fit of a statistical model to a sample of data for
  given values of the unknown parameters. [9]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally, for a design-matrix (rows are training examples and columns are features),
$\textbf X$, and true observation matrix (associated labels), $\textbf Y$, we define the likelihood
function as the probability of the joint distribution of the training data as a function
of the parameter(s) being estimated, in our case, $\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$.</p>

\[\mathcal{L}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}|
\textbf X_{m \space \times \space f},\textbf Y_{m \space \times \space 1})=\\
P(\textbf X_{m \space \times \space f},\textbf Y_{m \space \times \space 1};
\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}) 
\tag 8 \label 8\]

<p>Assuming a training set of size $M$ ad-impressions that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_independence">conditionally independent</a>
(but not identically distributed, i.e., different expected values) Bernoulli trials,
we can calculate the joint probability mass function for a given parameter,
$\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$.</p>

\[P(\textbf X_{m \space \times \space f},\textbf Y_{m \space \times \space 1};
\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}})=\\
\prod_{i = 1}^{M} h_\boldsymbol{\hat \theta}(\textbf{x}_i)^{y_i}
(1-h_\boldsymbol{\hat \theta}(\textbf{x}_i))^{1-y_i}
\tag 9 \label 9\]

<p>The value of the joint probability mass function may get very small as multiplying
small numbers by small numbers result in even smaller numbers. At some point, we may
hit computational floating-point arithmetic underflow errors. We can instead maximize the
log of the likelihood. One benefit of the log function is that it is a monotonically
increasing function, i.e., the log-transformation preserves ordering and doesn’t
change where the maximum is. Computationally, another benefit of the log function
is that it turns repeated multiplication into a summation. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_logarithmic_identities">list of logarithmic identities</a>
is a good refresher.</p>

\[ln(P(\textbf X_{m \space \times \space f},\textbf Y_{m \space \times \space 1};
\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}))=\\
\sum_{i = 1}^{M} {y_i} ln(h_\boldsymbol{\hat \theta}(\textbf{x}_i))
+ (1-y_i)ln(h_\boldsymbol{\hat \theta}(\textbf{x}_i))
\tag {10} \label {10}\]

<p>Most mathematical optimization algorithms implemented in software
are minimizers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">Gradient descent</a>, a well-suited minimization algorithm,
applies an iterative first-order hill-descent routine which converges
at a local minimum. In order to find the maximum of the log-likelihood function, we
instead find the minimum of the negative log-likelihood. Finally, we normalize by the
number of examples in the summation yielding the average log-loss. An added benefit
to the normalization is that the number of examples fed in is not a factor, i.e.,
if we wanted to compare the average log-loss over some batch size.</p>

\[-\frac{1}{M}ln(P(\textbf X_{m \space \times \space f},\textbf Y_{m \space \times \space 1};
\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}))=\\
-\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i = 1}^{M} {y_i} ln(h_\boldsymbol{\hat \theta}(\textbf{x}_i))
+ (1-y_i)ln(h_\boldsymbol{\hat \theta}(\textbf{x}_i))
\tag {11} \label {11}\]

<h4 id="binomial">Binomial</h4>

<p>Through a similar but slightly different point of view, the <strong>overall</strong> or prior click propensity
follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">Binomial distribution</a>. Its PMF yields the probability of getting
exactly $k$ clicks in a series of $n$ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independently and identically distributed</a> (i.i.d)
ad-impressions (Bernoulli trials) under one common click propensity, $p$.</p>

\[P(k;n,p) \sim\\
Binomial(n, k, p)=\\
\binom{n}{k} p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
\tag {12} \label {12}\]

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient">binomial coefficient</a> scales the value of the PMF by the number of combinations that $k$
clicks could have occurred within a series of $n$ ad-impressions.
Since it is a constant, it won’t have any effect on the maximum and can be safely ignored.
We’re then left with a series of i.i.d Bernoulli trials to which we can apply very similar
mathematics from the Bernoulli derivation above. Naturally, the Binomial MLE resolves to the
prior CTR, $\frac{k}{n}$. In other words, the Binomial likelihood is maximal under a fixed number of
trials at the observed success rate.</p>

<h3 id="information-theory-derivation">Information Theory derivation</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information.
  It was originally proposed by Claude Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal
  processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper titled
  “A Mathematical Theory of Communication”. [10]</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="information-content">Information content</h4>

<p>Given random variable $X$ with PMF $P_{X}(x)$, we can measure the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_content#Definition">information</a>, $I_X$, of
outcome, $x$, as the log (usually base $e$, $2$, or $10$) inverse probability of that outcome.</p>

\[I_X(x)=\\
ln(\frac{1}{P_X(x)})
\tag {13} \label {13}\]

<h5 id="why-the-inverse-probability">Why the inverse probability?</h5>

<p>The inverse probability or “surprisal” for a given outcome is larger when the outcome is less likely
and smaller when the outcome is more likely. In other words, events that occur very frequently
don’t carry as much information as events that occur rarely. Intuitively, less-likely events
carry more information because they inform us that not only they’ve occurred but that their more
likely counterparts didn’t occur. For example, when drawing a letter randomly from the 5 character
string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABBBB</code>, the probability of drawing an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> is $0.2$ while the probability of drawing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code> is
$0.8$. If we draw <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>, we can eliminate $\frac{1}{.2}=5$ characters, that is, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> because it
occurred and all of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>s because we know they didn’t occur. If we draw <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>, we can eliminate
$\frac{1}{.8}=1.25$ characters, that is, the one and only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> because we know it didn’t occur and
a quarter of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>s because we know one of them occurred. Since, drawing an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> allows us to
eliminate more characters from the string, it carries more information.</p>

<h5 id="why-the-logarithmic-transform">Why the logarithmic transform?</h5>

<p>Directly from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>’s white-paper.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The logarithmic measure is more convenient for various reasons:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>It is practically more useful. Parameters of engineering importance such as time, bandwidth,
  number of relays, etc., tend to vary linearly with the logarithm of the number of possibilities.
  For example, adding one relay to a group doubles the number of possible states of the relays.
  It adds 1 to the base 2 logarithm of this number. Doubling the time roughly squares the number of
  possible messages, or doubles the logarithm, etc.</li>
    <li>It is nearer to our intuitive feeling as to the proper measure. This is closely related to (1)
  since we intuitively measures entities by linear comparison with common standards. One feels,
  for example, that two punched cards should have twice the capacity of one for information storage,
  and two identical channels twice the capacity of one for transmitting information.</li>
    <li>It is mathematically more suitable. Many of the limiting operations are simple in terms of the
  logarithm but would require clumsy restatement in terms of the number of possibilities. [11]</li>
  </ol>

<p>Entropy, $H$, is the expected value of information. For a discrete random variable, $X$, it is the
weighted average of the information of each of its outcomes.</p>

\[H(X)=\\
\mathbb{E}_{x \sim P}[I_X]=\\
\sum_{i}^{N}P(x_i)ln(\frac{1}{P(x_i)})=\\
-\sum_{i}^{N}P(x_i)ln(P(x_i))
\tag {14} \label {14}\]

<p>Entropy can be interpreted as a measure of chaos and/or uncertainty in that it is maximized
when outcomes are equiprobable, i.e., carry the same amount of information (uniform PMF),
and minimized or $0$ when outcomes are certain. In the case of a binary random variable, it is
maximal when each outcome has a $0.5$ probability mass. It is minimized or $0$ when one of the
outcomes have a $1.0$ probability (the other having a $0.0$ probability). We can measure entropy as
the average number of bits required to encode the information content of a random variable by
substituting $log_2$ for $ln$ into \ref{14}.</p>

\[-0.5log_2(0.5)-0.5log_2(0.5)=1
\tag {15} \label {15}\]

\[-1.0log_2(1.0)-0.0log_2(0.0)=\\
-0.0log_2(0.0)-1.0log_2(1.0)=0
\tag {16} \label {16}\]

<p>On average, we need one bit to represent a fair coin and no bits to represent a double-headed or
double-tailed coin because no matter what, we know the outcome. The lack of stochasticity implies
that we don’t need to flip the coin as we know the outcome a priori.</p>

<h4 id="cross-entropy">Cross-entropy</h4>

<p>Cross-entropy (CE) measures the expected value of information for random variable, $X$, with PMF,
$P$, using a coding scheme optimized for another, $Y$, with PMF, $Q$, over the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_(mathematics)">support</a>, i.e.,
set of outcomes/events.</p>

\[H(X,Y)=\\
\mathbb{E}_{x \sim P}[I_Y]=\\
\sum_{i}^{N}P(x_i)ln(\frac{1}{Q(x_i)})=\\
-\sum_{i}^{N}P(x_i)ln(Q(x_i))
\tag {17} \label {17}\]

<p>If $X = Y$, then CE resolves to entropy. If $X \neq Y$, CE can be expressed
in terms of entropy and Kullback–Leibler divergence.</p>

\[H(X,Y)=\\
H(X) + D_{KL}(X||Y)
\tag {18} \label {18}\]

<h4 id="kullbackleibler-divergence">Kullback–Leibler divergence</h4>

<p>Assuming random variables $X$ and $Y$ with respective PMFs $P$ and $Q$ over common support,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback–Leibler divergence</a> (KLD) is the expected logarithmic difference between the two or
equivalently, the expected logarithm over likelihood ratios.</p>

\[D_{KL}(X||Y) =\\
\mathbb{E}_{x \sim P}[ln(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)})]=\\
\sum_{i}^{N}P(x_i)ln(\frac{P(x_i)}{Q(x_i)})
\tag {19} \label {19}\]

<p>It’s an asymmetric measure with a minimal value at 0, meaning the distributions are identical.
The inequality implies that KLD is not a distance metric, hence the word “divergence” in its name.</p>

\[D_{KL}(X||Y) \neq D_{KL}(Y||X)
\tag {20} \label {20}\]

<p>Based on the definition of CE in \ref{18}, KLD can be understood as the average
<em>extra</em> information required to be encoded since we’ve calculated the entropy of $X$ using a
potentially suboptimal encoding scheme (from $Y$). Notice, again, if the KLD is $0$, then the
CE of $X$ is just the entropy of $X$ and that if it is $&gt; 0$ then the CE of
$X$ is the entropy of $X$ plus some additional divergence, which yields a suboptimal encoding for
$X$.</p>

<h4 id="minimizing-cross-entropy--kullbackleibler-divergence">Minimizing cross-entropy / Kullback–Leibler divergence</h4>

<p>LR is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">supervised learning</a> algorithm because it learns to map inputs
to outputs based on training example input-output pairs. For each training example,
the outcome has already been observed, i.e., the probability that the user clicked is either
$1.0$ or $0.0$. LR learns by comparing its prediction to the respective outcome and correcting
itself. Since both prediction and outcome binary probability distributions cover the same support,
CE applies as a measure of how close the prediction distribution is to the outcome distribution.</p>

<p>The entropy of an observed outcome is $0$ because the act of observation collapses the probabilistic
nature of what could have happened, e.g., if a user clicked, the entropy is $0$ because there is
complete certainty the event has occurred. The same applies if the user decided not to click. See
\ref{16}. Since the entropy of the reference distribution, $X$, is $0$, we can eliminate $H(X)$ from
\ref{18} when calculating the CE. Thus, in this case, minimizing CE is equivalent to minimizing KLD.</p>

\[H(X,Y)=\\
0 + D_{KL}(X||Y)=\\
D_{KL}(X||Y)
\tag {21} \label {21}\]

<h4 id="cross-entropy-loss">Cross-entropy loss</h4>

<p>There’s no need to write out the mathematics for calculating CE loss over $M$ training examples
because we’ve already derived it via probability theory. Minimizing the average CE of $M$ training
examples is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood of those $M$
training examples under the <a href="#bernoulli">Bernoulli</a> model. That’s two schools of thought arriving
at the same conclusion with the same equation :P!</p>

<p>If the connection between the two isn’t obvious, compare and contrast \ref{11} and \ref{17}. What
happens if we calculate the CE between the model’s prediction and the observed outcome
(\ref{22}/\ref{23})? What happens if we do that for all $M$ training examples and then take the
average?</p>

<h2 id="visualizing">Visualizing…</h2>

<h3 id="log-loss--cross-entropy">Log-loss / cross-entropy</h3>

<p>CE is applied during model training/evaluation as an objective function which measures model
performance. The model learns to estimate Bernoulli distributed random
variables by iteratively comparing its estimates to natures’ and penalizing itself for more costly
mistakes, i.e., the further its prediction is from what has been observed, the higher the
cost that is realized. For simplicity, let’s assume observed and estimated binary response
random variables, $Y$ and $\hat Y$ with respective PMFs $P$ and $Q$, that represent the modeled
propensity and outcome for some user clicking on some ad.</p>

\[H(Y, \hat Y)=\\
-\sum_{i}^{N}P(x_i)ln(Q(x_i))
\tag {22} \label {22}\]

<p>Since $P(x_i)$ is always either $1.0$ or $0.0$, as it is the observed outcome, CE can be expanded
as the sum of two mutually exclusive negated log functions of which only one
gets activated according to the observed outcome. Since our model outputs the probability of a
click as $Q(x)$, the complement probability of not clicking is $1-Q(x)$.</p>

\[-((P(x) \cdot ln(Q(x))) +\\
((1-P(x)) \cdot ln(1-Q(x))))=\\
\left \{
  \begin{aligned}
    &amp;-ln(Q(x)), &amp;&amp; P(x)=1.0 \\
    &amp;-ln(1-Q(x)), &amp;&amp; P(x)=0.0
  \end{aligned} \right.
\tag {23} \label {23}\]

<p>Perhaps a bit cleaner, the PMFs can be replaced with $p$ and $\hat p$ from \ref{3} and \ref{2}.</p>

\[-((p \cdot ln(\hat p)) +\\
((1-p) \cdot ln(1-\hat p)))=\\
\left \{
  \begin{aligned}
    &amp;-ln(\hat p), &amp;&amp; p=1.0 \\
    &amp;-ln(1-\hat p), &amp;&amp; p=0.0
  \end{aligned} \right.
\tag {24} \label {24}\]

<p><a href="#fig-1">Fig 1.</a> [13] shows the cost our model realizes when the outcome is a click (in blue) and
not a click (in orange).</p>

<p>If the outcome is a click (outcome probability of a click is $1.0$),
and the model predicts a probability of $1.0$, the model realizes a cost
of $0.0$, i.e., the model isn’t penalized as the prediction is perfectly reflective of the outcome.
In the case that the model predicts anything less than $1.0$, it will realize a cost that grows
exponentially as the prediction moves further away from $1.0$.</p>

<p>If the outcome is not a click (outcome probability of a click is $0.0$), the reflection
of the same logic applies, i.e., the model must predict $0.0$ to realize a cost of $0.0$
and that cost grows exponentially as the model’s prediction moves further away from $0.0$.</p>

<h3 id="normalized-log-loss--cross-entropy">Normalized log-loss / cross-entropy</h3>

<h4 id="click-through-rate-entropy">Click-through rate entropy</h4>

<p>The NCE (\ref{4}) denominator can be expressed as the entropy (\ref{14}) of the prior CTR which
is equivalent to the average log-loss if the model always predicted the CTR.</p>

\[-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (p_i ln(CTR) + (1-p_i) ln(1-CTR))=\\
-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N p_i ln(CTR)-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N(1-p_i) ln(1-CTR)=\\
-\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{p_iln(CTR)}{N}-\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{(1-p_i) ln(1-CTR)}{N}=\\
-(CTR \cdot ln(CTR) + (1-CTR) \cdot ln(1-CTR))
\tag {25} \label {25}\]

<h5 id="fig-2">Fig. 2</h5>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deychak/notebooks/master/experiments/images/ctr_ent.png" alt="ctr_ent" /></p>

<p><a href="#fig-2">Fig. 2</a> [13] shows entropy as a function of CTR. It is maximized at a CTR of
$0.5$ when clicking is just as likely as not clicking. The more the CTR drifts from $0.5$,
in either direction, the resulting entropy symmetrically decreases. At a CTR of $0.0$ or $1.0$,
the entropy would be $0.0$ as there would be complete certainty of the outcome from the data, e.g.,
only clicks or no clicks at all.</p>

<h5 id="fig-3">Fig. 3</h5>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deychak/notebooks/master/simulations/images/prior_log_loss_sim.png" alt="prior_log_loss_sim" /></p>

<p><a href="#fig-3">Fig. 3</a> [14] shows the result of a simulating \ref{25} while varying training set
size. The CE of each training example outcome, $\sim Bernoulli(0.3)$, and prediction, $0.3$ (prior),
is averaged over the $N$ prediction-outcome pairs.
As the size of the training set increases, the empirical cross-entropy converges to the expected
prior entropy of $-.3log(.3)-(1-.3)log(1-.3)=.610$.</p>

<h5 id="fig-4">Fig. 4</h5>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deychak/notebooks/master/simulations/images/prior_sim.png" alt="prior_sim" /></p>

<p><a href="#fig-4">Fig. 4</a> [14] shows the result of a simulating the proportion of observations that
resulted in a positive label while varying training set size. The proportion converges to the
expected value as the number of trials or size of the training set increases. Since each outcome
for in a given training set size follows $Bernoulli(0.3)$, we’d expect the sampled proportion to
converge to $0.3$ as we simulate larger training set sizes.</p>

<p>Both simulations are manifestations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">law of large numbers</a>. As the prior converges, so does
the entropy of the prior since mathematically (\ref{25}), it is dependent on it.</p>

<h4 id="baseline-model">Baseline model</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>When doing supervised learning, a simple sanity check consists of comparing one’s estimator
  against simple rules of thumb.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>stratified: generates random predictions by respecting the training set class distribution.</li>
    <li>most_frequent: always predicts the most frequent label in the training set.</li>
    <li>prior: always predicts the class that maximizes the class prior (like most_frequent) and
predict_proba returns the class prior.</li>
    <li>uniform: generates predictions uniformly at random.</li>
    <li>constant: always predicts a constant label that is provided by the user. [12]</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>NCE is defined (see \ref{4}) as the predictive log-loss normalized by the log-loss of a baseline
prior model, i.e., a model which always outputs the probability of a click as the observed CTR.
One way to visualize the behavior of the normalization is to restrict the model’s predictions
to various hypothetical CTRs.</p>

\[\hat p = \hat{CTR}
\tag {26} \label {26}\]

<p>That constraint means our model’s predictions are a constant and NCE can be broken into two
mutually exclusive terms and visualized separately.</p>

\[NCE=\\
\frac
{
-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (p_i ln(\hat p_i) + (1-p_i) ln(1-\hat p_i))
}
