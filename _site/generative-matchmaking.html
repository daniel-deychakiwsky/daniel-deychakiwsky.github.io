<h2 id="dating">Dating</h2>

<p>Popular dating services have converged to an experience
where users must swipe, match, chat, and plan to meet. 
For many users, this results in too much time spent
repeatedly swiping, small talking, and planning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I‚Äôm looking for a connection where I can simply ask, 
‚ÄúWould you like to meet up for drinks later?‚Äù 
I wish online dating could solely serve the purpose 
of arranging dates, eliminating the need for aimless small talk. 
Repeating the same text-based conversations that lead nowhere gets tiresome. 
Meeting in person right away would allow us to gauge our compatibility and save time. 
‚Äì <cite>I‚Äôm a 27-year-old female.</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Inspired by the emergence of human-like behavior in modern AI, 
our vision is to create an experience where each user is paired 
with a personalized AI matchmaking assistant. This assistant 
can adapt to changes in user preferences with the help of human 
feedback and works behind the scenes to connect with other user 
assistants, creating harmonious matches. The goal is to reduce 
the time users spend searching and increase the time they spend 
meeting people. We believe that this approach can minimize swipe 
time, eliminate small talk, and assist in planning. The remainder
of this post provides details on a simulated subset of functionality 
that integrates into the overall effort.</p>

<h2 id="framework">Framework</h2>

<p>We focused on dating as an application
of matchmaking. However, we argue that our 
framework generalizes to a broad spectrum
of use cases, e.g., jobs, philanthropy, customer churn,
e-commerce, and overall business intelligence.</p>

<h1 id="simulation">Simulation</h1>

<p>The simulated implementation is available in a public GitHub 
<a href="https://github.com/daniel-deychakiwsky/generative-matchmaking">repository</a>. 
As a proof-of-concept, we generated synthetic dating user profiles 
with pictures and produced matches for each of them, 
all of which are stored in the <a href="https://github.com/daniel-deychakiwsky/generative-matchmaking/tree/master/profiles">profiles</a> directory. 
We also generated assisted date plans for an example 
pair of matched users.</p>

<h2 id="generating-synthetic-users">Generating Synthetic Users</h2>

<h3 id="profiles">Profiles</h3>

<p>We sequentially generated 250 synthetic dating user profiles using OpenAI‚Äôs chat 
completion endpoint with the following configuration settings.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s">"model"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"gpt-4-0613"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s">"max_tokens"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">5000</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s">"temperature"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">1.05</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Initially, our attempt to generate numerous dating 
profiles in a single inference pass, allowing the model to consider previously generated 
profiles for uniqueness and diversity, was hindered by output token limit constraints. 
To address this, we adopted an alternative approach: we chatted with the model
to generate a collection of names and subsequently instructed the model to sample from this pool
as a seed for profile generation.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[System Message]: You are a helpful assistant.

[User Message]: Generate 10 unique first and last names, 
ensuring a balanced diversity.

[Assistant Message]: ...

[User Message]: Select a name randomly and create 
a dating profile for the chosen name.

[Assistant Message]: ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It‚Äôs worth noting that the sampling process suffers from positional biases inherent 
in language models. Nevertheless, we observed that this strategy, at the very least, 
improved generation of a diverse set of names across all users.</p>

<p>For the generation of the dating profile, we utilized OpenAI‚Äôs function calling API, which 
produced a structured JSON response based on our dating profile <a href="https://github.com/daniel-deychakiwsky/generative-matchmaking/blob/master/src/generative_matchmaking/llm/oai_function_schemas.py">schema</a> where 
we hardcoded the dating location to Los Angeles, California for all users. Note that
although our schema is basic, it can be extended to include other pieces of static or dynamic
information along with the concept of ‚Äúdealbreakers‚Äù which effectively translates
to a hard filter on specified partner preference attributes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Developers can now describe functions to gpt-4-0613 and gpt-3.5-turbo-0613, 
and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing 
arguments to call those functions. 
This is a new way to more reliably connect GPT‚Äôs capabilities with external tools and APIs.
These models have been fine-tuned to both detect when a function needs to be 
called (depending on the user‚Äôs input) and to respond with JSON that 
adheres to the function signature. Function calling allows developers 
to more reliably get structured data back from the model. ‚Äì <cite>OpenAI docs.</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After generating the dating profile, we instructed the model 
to exclusively summarize both the user‚Äôs dating profile and 
their partner preferences.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>...
[User Message]: Summarize the user's dating profile. 
Include all fields other than partner_preferences. 
Output a concise paragraph.

[Assistant Message]: ...

[User Message]: Summarize the user's dating partner_preferences. 
Include partner_preferences fields only and nothing else. 
Output a concise paragraph.

[Assistant Message]: ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We did not include the user‚Äôs name in the summarization instruction context 
to maintain generality across users. An example synthetic dating profile follows.</p>

<h3 id="recommender-system">Recommender System</h3>

<p>Mainstream dating apps train hybrid recommender systems that model content-based
and collaborative filtering effects based on a robust set of features
including explicit / implicit user interactions, e.g., swiping, time-on-page, etc.
Modern recommender systems are implemented as a conglomerate of
individual components that often implement retrieval and ranking as separate tasks.</p>

<p>Researchers have shown that LLMs generalize as zero-shot recommenders but,
through ablation studies, found that they‚Äôre primarily content-based
and that they struggle with non-trivial ranking tasks, 
likely connected to their inherent positional bias.</p>

<p>Since our study lacked human feedback, we experimented with
a prompt-based zero-shot retrieval mechanism but realized this approach
would not scale effectively due to context-window limits. Instead,
we implemented retrieval as semantic vector search. To rank the retrieved 
output, we experimented with prompt engineering the ranking task but 
the results clearly suffered from artifacts of positional bias. 
Although bootstrapping the ranking task alleviated some concern 
by reducing variance and thereby stabilizing rankings, 
the results did not suffice, so we chose to implement 
a graph inspired ranking heuristic.</p>

<h4 id="chroma-vector-database">Chroma Vector Database</h4>

<p>We spun up a local and persistent version of <a href="https://www.trychroma.com/">Chroma</a>, 
an AI-native open-source vector database. By default, 
Chroma uses the Sentence Transformers <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">all-MiniLM-L6-v2</code> 
model to create embeddings. This embedding model can create sentence and 
document embeddings that can be used for a wide variety of tasks. 
This embedding function runs locally, downloading and caching the model files.
We loaded every user‚Äôs <strong>profile summary</strong>, as a document, 
into a <em>collection</em> and tagged each entry with the user‚Äôs gender
and sexuality as <em>metadata</em> for which we manually enforce as
‚Äúdealbreakers‚Äù or hard filters.</p>

<p>Chroma‚Äôs default embedding model maps documents 
to $\mathbb{R}^{384}$ (384 dimensional space). We
visualized all 250 user dating profile summaries
by projecting them down to $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with the
T-SNE algorithm using Tensorflow‚Äôs Embedding <a href="https://projector.tensorflow.org">Projector</a>.
The result follows.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/generative_matchmaking/embeddings.gif" alt="embeddings" /></p>

<p>We assume that the two global clusters represent gender.
An interesting application of these natural language
embeddings as a product feature is that users could issue 
queries to find partners by simply typing, e.g., 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for a ‚Ä¶ that plays ultimate frisbee and ‚Ä¶ ‚Äú.</p>

<h5 id="retrieval">Retrieval</h5>

<p>Recall that we created two summaries for each user that were <em>mutually exclusive</em>.
To compute an initial set of candidates for a given query user, we searched the Chroma <em>collection</em>
with their <strong>partner preferences summary</strong> and specified a hard <em>metadata</em> filter based on 
their partner preference gender and sexuality. Under the hood, Chroma
executes a similarity / distance lookup on the embedded query text and returns the
closest <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n_results</code> or neighbors sorted by ascending distance. Choosing a distance metric and an
appropriate value for the number of neighbors are hyperparameters which can be tuned 
to the use case. We configured Chroma to use <em>cosine</em> distance and to return the 25 closest 
neighbors.</p>

<h5 id="ranking">Ranking</h5>

<p>The retrieved set of candidate user profiles for a given user can 
naively be surfaced as matches for human feedback but some of those
candidates may be better matches than others. Borrowing from graph theory, 
we built a graph by treating users as nodes and adding retrieval-distance 
weighted edges for every user-candidate pair of nodes connecting
a query user to their retrieved candidate set.</p>

<p>We defined compatibility as a bidirectional connection between two users where a retrieved 
candidate‚Äôs retrieved set of candidates includes the query user. 
These candidates, that point back to query user, are ranked higher than those that don‚Äôt. 
This can be thought of as one level of breadth-first search.
To illustrate, user $M$ is compatible with the ordered set of users 
$\{C, B, P\}$ in the diagram that follows.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/generative_matchmaking/graph.png" alt="graph" /></p>

<h3 id="visualizing-matches">Visualizing Matches</h3>

<p>To visualize matches, we hacked together a user interface with directions
on how to run it outlined in the repo‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/daniel-deychakiwsky/generative-matchmaking/blob/master/README.md">readme</a>. A screenshot of Theodore Heath‚Äôs matches,
ranked from left-to-right, follows. The presence of an asterisk by the name of a 
match indicates a bidirectional connection (compatibility) while the others
are unidirectional matches with one directed edge pointing from Theodore to the 
candidate match.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/generative_matchmaking/ui.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>

<p>The most compatible match recommended for Theodore Heath is Olivia Windsor.
Theodore and Olivia being marked as a compatible match means that
Theodore‚Äôs <strong>partner preferences summary</strong> is semantically similar to Olivia‚Äôs
<strong>profile summary</strong> and that Olivia‚Äôs <strong>partner preferences summary</strong> is semantically
similar to Theodore‚Äôs <strong>profile summary</strong> within the embedding geometry.
In other words, Theodore is looking for someone like Olivia and
Olivia is looking for someone like Theodore based on the information
available to us. We can inspect Theodore and Olivia‚Äôs profile and 
partner preferences summaries to qualitatively evaluate the match. 
Our matching algorithm can be thought of as a soft matcher
with a hard filter on preferred sexuality and gender.</p>

<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>

<p>Once the matches were made, we generated personalized first-date
activities and talking points by applying 
a technique known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
where we instructed a LLM to assume a role of an expert creative date planner or
conversationalist conditioning the generative task on user information.
This is a form of in-context learning where the LLM
is fed information retrieved from an external storage system
to aid in performing a task. Analogous to how the human brain stores information
in long-term and short-term memory, the external system is the AI‚Äôs long-term memory
whereas the LLM‚Äôs context-window is its short-term memory.
In the sections that follow, we report results 
for Theodore and Olivia, our example match from the previous section.
The AI system plans based on their information, e.g., 
who they are, what they like, what they want, what city they‚Äôre meeting in, etc.
We used a basic Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting strategy that incites the model
to break down its reasoning process. There are more advanced prompting 
strategies that we‚Äôve left to future spikes, e.g., Tree of Thought (ToT).
We used the following configuration for both tasks.</p>
